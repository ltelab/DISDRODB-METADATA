summary: ''
history: ''
comment: An LLAP event was forecast to produce 5-6 feet of snow on the Tug Hill Plateau
  with "hostile" cold weather and strong winds. The LLAP was expected to be oscillatory
  during the overnight period but eventually become more steady state just to the
  north of the Utah MRR transect. Two UKWA flights occurred, the first a lawnmower
  through the band and the second a direct transit through the band.
