comment:
  A band-like structure, exhibiting small cellular features, formed early in
  the day near Oswego and persisted through the afternoon and early evening. The band
  was oriented approximately 280-290 degrees to the shoreline. Surface assets and
  soundings targeted this band. More substantial snow occurred with an E-W oriented
  band near Pulaksi, NY. The WY King Air flew parallel to the long axis of the lake.
  Upwind soundings were obtained in Ontario, Canada.
