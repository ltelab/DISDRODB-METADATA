title: Charleston Disdrometer Network
description: An ultra dense Thies Clima laser precipitation monitor array designed
  to study spatial an temporal rainfall microphysical rainfall variability on sub-100
  meter scales
project_name: Charleston Disdrometer Network
keywords: ''
summary: A dense array of optical disdrometers was deployed to measure rainfall simultaneously
  across a small spatial area (approximately 100 m x 100 m). Each instrument recorded
  one-minute summary data telegrams transmitted via serial cable to a central computer
  located about 80 m west of the array. The setup enabled high-resolution measurement
  of raindrop arrivals and rain rates at multiple closely spaced points. The objective
  was to assess how instrumental sampling variability and small-scale spatial variability
  influence the identification and characterization of individual rain events.
