comment: "The Lutjewad atmospheric measurement station on the northern coast of the Netherlands is situated approximately 30 km northeast from the city of Groningen. The rural landscape to the south consists mainly of pasture and cropland with patches of forested land with livestock dominated by dairy cows and sheep. Set up directly behind the Wadden Sea dike, the site features a 60 meter tall sampling tower, a 10 meter platform, a laboratory building, and an aerosol laboratory container. The station monitors greenhouse gases and trace gas species, sampling aerosol number, size, and composition at different altitudes. Lutjewad is part of the European research infrastructure ICOS, providing continuous greenhouse gas concentrations. The coastal location means that the site samples relatively clean marine background air in conditions of northerly winds and more polluted air masses during conditions of south-easterly and south-westerly winds."
