title: TU Delft optical disdrometer data Thies006 at Green Village in Delft
description: ''
project_name: Ruisdael
keywords: ''
summary: ''
history: ''
comment: The Green Village site is different from the other Ruisdael sites. Its primary
  purpose is to allow researchers to test sensors, perform calibration and develop
  new hardware/software solutions. The Green Village also serves as a temporary home
  basis for all the mobile sensors used during field campaigns. Due to the special
  nature of this site, data quality, reliability and availability may be lower than
  at other locations. There are also some nearby obstacles such as trees and fences
  which may affect the accuracy of the precipitation measurements depending on local
  wind patterns.
